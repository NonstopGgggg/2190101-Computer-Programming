##Exercise 9-6.2: Write the following functions all accepting one list of integers. You must use list comprehension to implement all functions.

* ```to_list_of_strings(x)``: returns the list with all elements of the input list converted to strings, e.g., returning ```['1', '2', '3']``` for the input ```[1,2,3]```.

* ```get_positive(x)```: returns the list consisting only of positive elements in the input list (retaining their order), e.g., returning ```[1,9,3]``` for the input ```[0,1,0,-2,9,3,-4] ```.

* ```get_peak_indexes(x)```: returns the indinces of the input list with all elements in the input list, each of which is larger than the prior and subsequent elements in the input list, e.g., returning ```[2,5,8]``` for the input ```[0,1,9,3,4,99,3,4,6,0,9]```.
