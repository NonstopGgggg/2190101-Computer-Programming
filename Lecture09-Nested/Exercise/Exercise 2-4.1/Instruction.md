Exercise 9-4.1: Write the function ```to_buckets(d)``` accepting ```d``` as a list of integers that returns a list of size 10, 
where the k-th item will be the list of all integers in ```d``` whose the least significant digit is ```k```, e.g.,

```to_buckets([33,21,143,33,11]) = [[], [21, 11], [], [33, 143, 33], [], [], [], [], [], []]```.
